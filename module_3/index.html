          <p>Idli or idly are a type of savoury rice cake, originating from the Indian subcontinent, popular as breakfast foods in Southern India and in Sri Lanka. The cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils (de-husked) and rice. The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are more readily metabolized by the body. Idli has several variations, including rava idli, which is made from semolina. Regional variants include sanna of Konkan. A precursor of the modern idli is mentioned in several ancient Indian works. Vaddaradhane, a 920 CE Kannada language work by Shivakotiacharya mentions "iddalige", prepared only from a black gram batter.[1] Chavundaraya II, the author of the earliest available Kannada encyclopedia, Lokopakara (c. 1025 CE), describes the preparation of this food by soaking black gram in buttermilk, ground to a fine paste, and mixed with the clear water of curd and spices.[2] The Western Chalukya king and scholar Someshwara III, reigning in the area now called Karnataka, included an idli recipe in his encyclopedia, Manasollasa (1130 CE).

          <p>A dosai or dosa or dose is a thin pancake or crepe, originating from South India, made from a fermented batter predominantly consisting of lentils and rice. It is somewhat similar to a crepe in appearance, although savoury flavours are generally emphasized (sweet variants also exist). Its main ingredients are rice and black gram, ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt, then fermented. Dosas are a common dish in South Indian cuisine, but now have become popular all over the Indian subcontinent. Dosas are served hot along with chutney by tradition and sambar in recent times. Other accompaniments include chutney powder (a fine groundnut and lentil powder). In ancient times the millets were the staple food of South Indian region and not the paddy/rice. From ancient literature, scriptures and stone edicts it can be found that the rice originated from Ancient Tamilakam. The ancient Chola Nadu region is known to be the rice bowl. Most of the present day dishes like idli, dosai, appam, pittu/puttu are referenced in the ancient Tamil Sangam literature.

          <p>Pongal or Huggi is a popular South Indian rice dish. In Tamil "pongal" means "bubbling up". In Telugu and Kannada, pongali is a dish of rice mixed with boiled milk and sugar.[1]Huggi is derived from the Old Kannada word Puggi meaning "bubbled up, ballooned". The two varieties of pongal are chakarai pongal, which is sweet, and venn pongal, which is made from clarified butter. The word pongal generally refers to spicy venn pongal and is a common breakfast food. Chakarai pongal is made during the Pongal festival. Chakarai Pongal or Chakkara Pongali (transl.â€‰Sweet pongal) is generally prepared in temples as a prasadam, (an offering made to a deity). This type of pongal is made during the Pongal festival in Tamil Nadu and during Sankranthi festival in Andhra Pradesh. Ingredients can include rice, coconut, and mung bean. Chakarai Pongal is often sweetened with jaggery, which gives pongal a brown color, though it can be sweetened with white sugar instead. Venn (Tamil word for white) Pongal is a popular savory dish in Tamil, Sri Lankan and other South Indian homes and is typically served as a special breakfast especially in Tamil Nadu and Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka.
